## Info

- **Type:** Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
- **Common Usage:** Accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over a network, such as querying user and computer information within Active Directory environments.
- **Security Note:** LDAP typically operates over port 389 without encryption, making it susceptible to interception and man-in-the-middle attacks. It's recommended to use LDAPS (LDAP over SSL/TLS) on port 636 for secure communications.
